        <h3>My Awesome Adventure at Epcot &amp; Animal Kingdom</h3>

        <p>In June 2025, I had the most amazing trip ever with my brother, my mom, and my friends!</p>

        <h4>Epcot Highlights</h4>
        <p>At Epcot, we started the day by trying some delicious ice cream—it was so creamy and yummy!</p>
        <p>Then we watched “We The Kingdom” live—it was a super fun concert and the music was fantastic!</p>
        <p>The “Soarin' Around the World” ride was so cool; it felt like we were flying over famous landmarks!</p>
        <p>And of course, we couldn't miss the Avatar ride—it was the best adventure with glowing forests and floating mountains!</p>

        <h4>Animal Kingdom Thrills</h4>
        <p>Over at Animal Kingdom, we zoomed down a roller coaster that dropped 200 feet—that was so exciting (and a little scary)!</p>
        <p>My favorite was “Guardians of the Galaxy.” I loved it so much, even though we had to wait about two hours to ride. It was totally worth it!</p>

        <h4>Which Park Was the Best?</h4>
        <p>It's hard to choose, but I think Epcot was my favorite—it had the tastiest treats, incredible shows, and the coolest rides!</p>

        <p>Overall, it was the most fun trip ever, and I can't wait to go back!</p>
